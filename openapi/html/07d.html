                          Dancer2::Plugin::Swagger2

     (probably about to be renamed)

     * It uses Swagger2 and JSON::Validator
     * First version written bei Daniel BÃ¶hmer during his
        work at STRATO AG who will support further development
     * You can use it already to play around; basics should
        be working, but there still are things to implement,
        especially since Jan Henning restructured his modules
        after Swagger was changed to OpenAPI
