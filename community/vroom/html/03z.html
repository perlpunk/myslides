                              perl-community.de

     * Started around 2003
     * Board was running previously on perl.de, but the domain was sold to
        someone wanting to make money with it, so we got our own domain and
        moved the whole community there
     * The number of threads is decreasing =( but this seems to happen to
        other perl boards too
     * Board is running on perl with a software created by me and community
        members.
