title: The Problem
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]I always prepare my slides at the last minute
  [*]The German Perl Workshop was approaching
  [*]I had to choose a presentation software
  [/list]

title: Vroom
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Vroom, written by Ingy, is a tiny tool for text based presentations
  [*]You edit your slides in vim (or any text editor)
  [*]You present them with vim
  [*]You only need basic vim knowledge
  [*]Great for putting slides together very fast, I used it a couple of times
  [*]It can also export to HTML
  [/list]
---
title: Vroom Limits
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Text only
  [*]You can only syntax highlight a complete slide with the available vim highlighters
  [/list]

title: LibreOffice
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]I started with LibreOffice
  [*]I wanted to show YAML example and highlight Tabs and Trailing Spaces
  [*]Couldn't find a way to set the background color of text parts
  [*]Like this:
  [/list]
  [codebox animation="5,flyin"]---
  String[tab]	[/tab]with[tab]	[/tab]tabs: value with trailing spaces[trspace]    [/trspace]
  map:      [comment]# comment[/comment]
  [indent]  [/indent]Indentation
  [/codebox]

title: Showing Transitions in one slide

  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]I wanted to show the process of YAML Loading in several steps
  [*]Without duplicating the same text over 10 slides!

title: Enter App::BBSlides
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]The slides file is a YAML document
  [*]Each document (slide) is written in BBCode:
  [*][codebox ]
  [noparse]
  [b]bold [i]italic[/i] text[/b]
  [/noparse]
  [/codebox]
  [*]I'm using Parse::BBCode (my own module), which is quite configurable
  [/list]

title: Embed HTML
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Sometimes you want to include HTML directly
  [*]You can do that with [noparse][html]<hr>[/html][/noparse]
  [*]You can also include content from a file directly:
  [*][noparse][include=foo.html][/noparse]
  [/list]

title: Terminal "Screenshots"
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Sometimes you want to do a live demo, but
  [*]...it could fail
  [*]...or you want to at least publish some terminal screenshots in your slides
  [*]Dump your terminal output including ansi color escapes
  [*](for example with `tmux capture-pane ...`)
  [*]Use the ansicolor.pl script to convert it to HTML
  [*]which is just a wrapper around HTML::FromANSI::Tiny by Randy Stauner

  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Hmm... alpha?
  [*]Just started it 2 weeks ago
  [*]I'll use it for The Perl Conference in Amsterdam
  [*]So I'll [b]have[/b] to work on it
  [/list]

title: Ideas
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]The BBCode could also be used to create a terminal presentation
  [*]Don't know if that would be useful
  [*]But I learned that everything text based makes it [b]really[/b] easy for remote pair programming
